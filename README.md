## Overview
This PCA analysis was conducted using data from https://data.boston.gov on Boston housing market data from 2024. Analysis was conducted using Principle Component Analysis from the package longpca. 
Longpca is an open source package developed by Karl Rohe at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We describe methods of analysis and then highlight variables of interest.

All code is linked in this github. Further detail and interpretation of findings can be found via the blog Data Over Dough: https://data-over-dough.netlify.app
